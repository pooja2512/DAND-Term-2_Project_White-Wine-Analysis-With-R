# White-Wine-Analysis-With-R

This project was completed as part of the course requirements of Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/) certification

> White wine is a wine whose colour can be straw-yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold. It is produced by the alcoholic fermentation of the non-coloured pulp of grapes, which may have a skin of any colour. White wine has existed for at least 2500 years

> The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

> Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

* 1 - fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)

* 2 - volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)

* 3 - citric acid (g / dm^3)

* 4 - residual sugar (g / dm^3)

* 5 - chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3

* 6 - free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)

* 7 - total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)

* 8 - density (g / cm^3)

* 9 - pH

* 10 - sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3)

* 11 - alcohol (% by volume)

* Output variable (based on sensory data): 
   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

> **Description of attributes:**

* 1 - fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)

* 2 - volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste

* 3 - citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines

* 4 - residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet

* 5 - chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine

* 6 - free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine

* 7 - total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine

* 8 - density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content

* 9 - pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale

* 10 - sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant

* 11 - alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine

>   Output variable (based on sensory data): 

* 12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
